# Mall Customer Segmentation

### Description:
This project "Mall Customer Segmentation" unites various kindof customers based upon the customer_data. By taking this segmentation, we could find the number of potential customers for that mall,thereby increasing our business value. This problem is tackled using an Unsupervised Clustering algorithm (KMeans algorithm). KMeans clustering algorithm is the optimised clustering algorithm on Machine Learning. 


### Procedure:
1. Imported the essential modules.
2. Download and imported the 'Mall Customer Segmentation' dataset from Kaggle.
3. Performed Exploratory Data analysis(heatmap analysis, correlation matrix) to found the dependence between features.
4. Trained on various cluster values to find the optimised cluster value from the loss vs Cluster plot.
5. Trained on the elbow cluster value (here n_cluster= 5) for the efficient model.
6. Visualised the model in both 2D,3D using Principal Component Analysis.
